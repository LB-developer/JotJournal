# JotJournal

JotJournalâ€™s core goal is simplicity: to provide a lightweight, no-nonsense way to annotate and track habits ("jots") without unnecessary complexity or distractions. This focus on minimalism addresses a common pain point in habit tracking - many apps overcomplicate what should be effortless.
